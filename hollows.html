                <h2>The Hollows of the Roots</h2>
                <br />
                <h3>The Roots of all Evil</h3>
                <p>
                    Long ago, a strange tree sprouted in the heart of the forest. It grew bigger and bigger, faster than any old tree could have feasibly grown. Its roots sucked all the life that had the misfortune to be within its reach. The grass underneath wilted. The ground dried up. The neighboring trees began to weaken and rot. And all the birds that dared come too close would never fly again.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    With every fresh kill, its roots became thicker and stronger. Further out it reached, spreading death wherever it went. It was a parasite on a mission, siphoning the power of the woods to keep itself alive. Except the woods would not let itself be defeated.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    A silent war began between these two forces of nature. For centuries they grappled for control. At first it seemed there would be no clear winner. But with every day the townfolk avoided the Roots was another day it spent without a new prey to feed on. It languished away in its small slice in the woods for years, waiting for someone–or something–foolish enough to finally fall into its trap.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Patience was all it took,  for someone foolish did eventually come. The roots seized its chance. With the flesh, blood, and soul of a human victim, its powers stirred anew, and the roots began to grow again, spreading themselves out in search for more. Soon, it found a way into the labyrinth, where it lay in wait for its next prey…
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The first outsider to set foot in that other dimension never made it to the other end. For the roots had taken them back to its nest and buried them alive.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Birth of the Hollows</h3>
                <p>
                    From death comes forth life. Or at least, its closest imitation. The first Hollow, molded from the flesh and soul of that unwitting victim from the outside world, emerged from the earth wet with blood that was not its own. It woke up violently, lying supine in a cradle of roots. Its first feeling? An insatiable hunger for violence. For this was its purpose: to seek out human victims and bring them to its maker.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The hunt commenced. One by one the outsiders, seized by this same inhuman foe, found themselves lost in this dead part of the woods. Here, the Roots buried them alive and transformed them anew. One by one, newborn Hollows emerged from the earth, the same hunger burning in their eyes, the same fantastic power coursing through their freshly-molded bodies. Their numbers grew. Their desires swelled. More blood. More violence. More death.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    All for the Roots.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    And yet, there is this strange new feeling, a sentience creeping up from the depths of their minds, awakened with every moment spent feigning ordinary lives. With it comes a growing fear: an understanding that, if the Roots catch on, they might just be its next victim.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    They will have to keep this to themselves; ignore the nagging little voice and keep chasing that rush of pleasure when the roots take another innocent soul.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    More violence. More blood. More death.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    That’s all there is to this cursed life.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Memories from Another Life</h3>
                <p>
                    The Hollows of the Roots are haunted by the memories of those that had been sacrificed to create them. More specifically, they remember the exact moments that transpired immediately before the ritual, as if they had experienced it all for themselves. Often these appear in their nightmares and dreams, or in moments of quiet and stillness when nothing else could distract them.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    They also experience memories from another source, the Roots. In these, they see themselves as a growing tree, an entity slowly spreading its roots across the forest, desperately sucking its power and life dry. They see centuries of isolation and survival, as well as a rising, ever-gnawing desire for revenge.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    These are only fragments of memories, not the complete picture. At the end of the day, a Hollow is a completely separate individual and will not know everything about their victims or the Roots. There is little hope of discovering beyond what they already know.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>A Hollow's Addiction</h3>
                <p>
                    It is only when a Hollow ignores its instinctual purpose that it experiences physical pain. It begins with a mild headache: a warning sign. If the Hollow persists, the pain will worsen, turning into head-splitting migraines or worse, spreading throughout their entire body. Beyond this the pain may evolve further, adjusting to a Hollow’s strengths and weaknesses until it becomes too agonizing, too unbearable to ignore: the sensation of being burned alive, of being drowned, of being consumed by maggots… The torture will intensify in brutally creative ways until a sacrifice is finally made.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The very moment the Roots are satiated, the torture will cease, and the Hollows will feel an instant rush of pleasure nothing else could possibly replicate. Then, and only then, are they rewarded with some semblance of blissful human normalcy… until the cycle begins once more, and the pain makes its unwanted return.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Abilities and Limitations</h3>
                <h4>Invincibility, Fatal flaw(s)</h4>
                <p>
                    It is clear that the Hollows of the Roots, despite appearing entirely human, are anything but. For one, the concept of blood is foreign to them. No matter how deep the cut, the scarlet river will not pour. Within them is only the intricate imitation of muscle and bone and all the things that to men are invaluable but to Hollows are not. They can survive the most brutal of mutilations without feeling a twinge of pain. They can have their lifeless hearts torn from their ligaments and still remain standing. The only thing that can kill a Hollow is its fatal flaw, whatever that may be.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    A fatal flaw may be a mole on one’s hand, the lick of a flame, a string of spoken words, or something else entirely. This, along with its effects, are unique to each and every Hollow. However, they do not themselves know what their fatal flaws are, or how these will affect them.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Regeneration</h4>
                <p>
                    Bone marrow gives Hollows the ability to regenerate. Adult human bone marrow is the most effective. It can regrow a single limb in mere days, while one sourced from a different animal is likely to take twice the amount of time or longer. Depending on the severity of their injuries, they may need multiple sources to heal completely. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Other Abilities</h4>
                <p>Hollows also possess abilities unique to each of them. This is up to the player.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>
                    Appearance-wise, the Hollows are the clones of those that had been sacrificed to manifest them. This means they have no choice but to assume the already established identities of their victims. On one hand, this is a good thing, as it enables them to assimilate easily among the people of Grimsby. Instead of hiding in the shadows, they can operate in plain sight. On the other, because they do not have all the memories of the original, it would be very easy to get caught in a lie and incite suspicion. For this reason, the Hollows of the Roots primarily target the outsiders, especially the new arrivals, as they have not been in Grimsby long enough to form meaningful relationships.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>A Portal to the Woods</h3>
                <p>
                    As with all curios that break the laws of our natural world, portal pairs are extremely rare due to their complexity. These often take the form of ordinary items that may seem inconspicuous at first glance. A mirror portal, for example, would feel solid, sturdy–a tangible thing with no extraordinary purpose–until a bit of force is applied on its surface. The hard mass gives way to the pressure and becomes viscous and penetrable, thus revealing its true magical nature.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    All portals lead to the Labyrinth–a place that, according to the Council, appears situated in some other dimension. It is a strange place, a world of branching tunnels and dark chambers of a scale so large as to be unimaginable. Those who enter the Labyrinth are thus cautioned not to stray too far from their portals, lest they never find their way back. Yet, despite its size, distances in the real world are greatly reduced in the Labyrinth. This makes for a useful tool for traveling long distances. To illustrate, two portals located on either end of the castle would be in neighboring proximity in this dimension. However, this also has other uses: for instance, one could use the portals to hide dangerous or unregistered curios and hollows, or even for gatherings held in secret.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Noteworthy is the fact that portals in this dimension look exactly like their counterparts in the real world. The mirror would remain a mirror, reflecting its new surroundings. The tapestry would remain a tapestry, in all its elaborately woven glory. Traveling council members will also find themselves unchanged, even after what feels like ages of wandering. Time, after all, runs differently in this otherworldly place. One could spend hours here only to find that only a few minutes have gone by in their world of origin.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>TAPESTRY</h4>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Status: Unregistered</li>
                        <li>Classification: Curio</li>
                        <li>Creator: TBA</li>
                        <li>Creation Date: 19th Century</li>
                        <li>Fatal Flaw: Unknown</li>
                        <li>In possession of: The Hollows (Current), The Council (Former)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    Ever since the early 19th century when it was first created, the tapestry had been a centerpiece in the Council Tower, used primarily by members as a secret alternative route to the woods. There, it was cleverly concealed. One of the tombs had been repurposed and locked from the inside so as to keep the tapestry safe. This way, no wandering architect would stumble upon it, and even if one were aware of its general location, the tombs are nigh-indistinguishable from each other that it would be difficult–if not impossible–to find it.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It was not until the arrival of the outsiders that both tapestries mysteriously disappeared, leading the Council to believe that these incidents are somehow correlated. In truth, one of the tapestries is now in the hands of the Hollows, whereas its pair is somewhere else in the woods, bound to the earth in that dark place sullied by death. The malevolent Roots keep it in place, its long twisting fingers penetrating the fibrous surface.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The tapestries are about five feet in both width and length and feature an ever-shifting pattern of interwoven worlds. They move ever so imperceptibly, the depictions ranging from a series of inconspicuous landscapes to rivers flowing with blood, trees made entirely from bones, or even mountains dotted with the silhouettes of large, mythical beings.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>The Castle Has Eyes</h3>
                <p>
                    Once in a blue moon, the Hollows might find an unsigned letter tucked underneath their portal in the woods. These letters typically reveal key information that aids the Hollows in their purpose.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
	                One of these letters mentions this: “The castle has eyes” Sure enough, every part of the castle with the exception of the tunnels is adorned with various statues–whether it be the classical innocuous bust or the more menacing gargoyles. This, as well as the castle’s clear signs of intelligence, means that the Hollows must take great care to keep a low profile and avoid being discovered. If they are otherwise found out, the castle’s ability to move walls and stairs could hamper their objectives, or worse, imprison them in an unending maze.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
	                Luckily, the Roots have gotten into the castle. It crawls between the walls and floors unseen, only to burst through the eyes of the statues like a blooming flower of veins. A quarter of the castle’s statues have been blinded and restricted in this way, leading to multiple dark spots prime for scheming and abducting and traveling through portals unnoticed.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>FAQ</h3>
                <h4>Can the Roots See?</h4>
                <p>The Roots do not have the ability to see and rely much on feeling and vibrations.</p>
                <br />
                <h4>Where is the tree from which the Roots originate?</h4>
                <p>The Roots have gotten so wild and long that it is difficult to track them. It is, at the moment, unknown where it comes from, or how its tree looks like.</p>
