                <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                <p>
                    At a time of great loss, the outsiders found themselves a visitor: a mysterious man by the name of Grimsworth. He claimed to be a teacher in a school of magic, a secret place where one might find a way to recover what they had lost, or discover something they didn’t know they were searching for. He left a mirror in their possession–a mirror that, at first, seemed entirely unremarkable. These were his parting words: When you see the crow, follow it at all costs.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It was madness. And the man? Simply delusional. But then one day, something remarkable did occur. In a flurry of black, a crow emerged from the mirror. It cawed at them, circling about the room, only to swoop back into its own reflection and disappear without a trace.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Follow the crow at all costs, the man had said.

                    <br />
                    And so into the mirror-portal they went, unaware of the nightmares that would soon become their reality.

                <h3>The Mysterious Grimsworth</h3>
                <p>
                    The circumstances surrounding their encounter with the mysterious man vary. In fact, the very identity of this person also changes depending on who you ask. Some say they were visited by none other than Grimsworth himself; others say it was an old woman they had randomly met at the street; still others swear that it was someone they had known awhile, like a good friend or a trusted mentor. Whoever it was, they had a presence most suited to the outsider’s personality, a charismatic figure they could easily trust and confide in. Little do they know these identities are mere fabrications–all faces of the same shapeshifting creature called Grimsworth.

                <h3>Through the Mirror-Portal</h3>
                <p>
                    Upon entering the mirror portal, the outsiders find themselves transported to what seems to be a dark room replete with identical mirrors. It soon dawns on them that following the crow is a lot harder than anticipated. This is no ordinary funhouse, after all, but rather a labyrinth conquered by inexplicable illusions. Beyond the mirrors, just out of reach, are the disembodied voices and fleeting manifestations of their deepest and darkest desires. They beckon the outsiders, tempting them to stray from the crow’s trail. Those who pay no heed to these illusions eventually find their way to the other mirror, on the other side of which the castle awaits. For those few who wander too close to the specters, however, a sinister fate at the hands of malevolent roots befalls them instead.

                <h3>Into the Castle</h3>
                <p>
                    The survivors arrive in an empty room, only to find that the crow is still forging ahead. They leave the mirror behind, unaware that as they go through one hallway and the next, they could never again retrace their steps and find their way back. Soon, they may run into others like them–some have been here a week, others a day–and just as they begin to discover the truth of their situation, the crow escapes through one of the arched windows and disappears into the mist.
