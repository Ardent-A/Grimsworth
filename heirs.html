                <h2>The Founding Families</h2>
                <br />
                <h3>Tale of the First Founders</h3>
                <p>
                    There are no reliable records that detail the beginnings of Grimsby, but there is one story that the Council actively endorses. It has gotten to the point that everyone else has accepted it as fact. This is the purported tale of the First Founders:
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    In the early 19th century, a group of orphans happened upon a castle in the woods–a castle that, they soon found, was inhabited by a strange, charismatic man by the name of Grimsworth. It was he who taught them the magic of the forest: that, in exchange for their blood, they could create anything they wanted by simply imagining it. For the orphans, who had experienced many evils in the outside world, this was everything. They were sick of the way disease ravages, how war and death needlessly takes, how life is so cruel in every shape and form. So, what if they lived here forever? What if they created a kingdom of their own, a kingdom that never changes, a haven immune to all the evils that plague the world Beyond? They got to work. They created people who never age: the farmers. They created a humble village alongside the river: Grimsby. Meanwhile, they themselves settled in the castle, a castle that had been there long before they arrived and would continue to remain long after they had passed.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    With time they learned they could never leave its boundaries. The forest’s magic had kept them shielded from the horrors of the world for so long that to step outside would mean instant death. But it mattered not: Grimsby was their haven.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Religion</h3>
                <p>
                    The closest thing Grimsby has to a religion is an unwavering reverence for the forest. This is no surprise, as Grimswood is not only the source of their power, but also the one thing that protects them from the Beyond.  By extension, its connected entities–the castle, the crows, and most especially the mentor Grimsworth–are treated with respect, if not equally venerated.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>The Three Evils</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Age. Disease. Death.</b> These are the so-called three evils, the curse and peril of man. It is so taboo to them that they cannot even bring themselves to say those words. Through the ages, Grimsby has been mostly immune to these evils, thanks to the forest which insulates them from the Beyond. Sickness is alien to the Founding Families, who have never experienced so much as a simple cold in their lives. Youth also seems to favor them, for they do not show visible signs of aging past their thirties. And though they are not immortal, no one has ever really died of old age in Grimsby, for they are taken away before death could come for them. (See Events: The Golden Expedition)
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>The Curse of the Beyond</h4>
                <p>
                    One of Grimsby’s widely held beliefs is implied in the Tale of the First Founders: the Beyond is thought to be a cesspool plagued with wars, pestilence, needless death, and above it all: change. Why leave Grimsby when all that awaits them on the other side is suffering? Why leave the womb of the woods–this wonderful place where anything could be whatever they want it to be, when the outside world is decidedly unmagical? They believe themselves to be the blessed ones, the few worthy enough to access the forest’s ancient power and use it for their own purposes.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Even the few skeptics that crop up once in a while are quick to change their tune once they see the edge of the woods themselves. There, all Founding Families are sure to experience that same nagging feeling that something is about to go horribly wrong. This is no trick of the mind. For the moment they step beyond the line of the trees, death begins to creep up on them, consuming them inch by inch. This phenomenon is known as the Curse of the Beyond. It is said that the Founding Families have been cocooned from the outside world for so long that their bodies can no longer survive such a treacherous place.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Rituals of Worship</h4>
                <p>
                    The mere act of sacrificing blood to the forest during a manifestation ritual is in itself an act of worship. But to ask for nothing in return is an even greater show of reverence. This is done in a biannually held event called the Red March (see Events: the Red March)
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    On the opposite end of the spectrum, it is considered blasphemous to enter the woods when one has no business being there. Only Heirs and Council Members are permitted to wander the woods unsupervised; ordinary Architects–for all their great abilities–are compelled to request authorization from the Council before setting foot in the forest. Meanwhile, the general population is forbidden from entering the woods at all, unless it is for an organized ritual like the Red March.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Death Rites</h4>
                <p>
                    In an effort to “immortalize” those who have already died, a group of Architects presided by an Heir will take the body to the woods, where it will be used as a sacrifice in a manifestation ritual. The simple act of burying the dead and leaving it there for the worms to feed upon is unthinkable to the Founding Families. It is seen as unnecessarily cruel due to their conception of death being an unnatural and evil thing.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Notable Laws</h3>
                <h4>Partnership, Intermarriage, and Reproduction</h4>
                <p>
                    For posterity’s sake, the five Founding Families are mandated by law to keep their respective bloodlines pure. Intermarriage presents many problems down the line, like murky allegiances that could throw off the equilibrium and destroy the foundations upon which the Council is built. In the same vein, romantic relations between the Families are not outlawed, but they are considered socially taboo. Should such a union result in a pregnancy and this is discovered, the punishment will be swift and severe.

                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Most are perfectly content to stick to tradition. For some, this tradition unsurprisingly involves incestuous relations. For others, bloodline is furthered through the use of Hollows made specifically for that purpose: the Surrogates. Regardless of one’s choice of partner, they must take care to only conceive during the mating period scheduled by the Council. This period typically lasts five years. Children conceived outside of the mating period will otherwise be seized by the Council, never to be seen again.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Such rules are strictly upheld because Grimsby’s population must be carefully regulated. Their entire existence relies on it. There are simply not enough resources to sustain a large population, and if there are too few people they risk extinction. This is also the reason why qualifications for eligibility change every year; the Council must adapt to the ever-changing circumstances.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Homicide</h4>
                <p>
                    Those guilty of the crime of homicide are punished with a fate worse than death: many months or even years of torture in the Tombs, forced to imagine horrific things into existence until their minds are broken beyond repair. This culminates on the day of the Scourging, where they are forced to walk beyond the boundary of the woods and made to suffer slow but inevitable deaths. (See Notable Events: The Scourging)
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Animal Ownership: Pets and Livestock</h4>
                <p>
                    There was an incident long ago, when an Architect single-handedly decimated most of Grimsby’s livestock and plunged the town into a state of near-famine. Since then, the Council has banned the use of animal blood in all manifestation rituals. The ownership of real animals–whether for companionship or for food–was also banned as a precautionary measure. Livestock is now exclusively under the care of the Hollow farmers who, despite their unassuming appearances, are said to be menacing figures to contend with. It has happened too often that a child sneaks out to the farmlands only to come home crying and out of breath, forever traumatized by the sight of an unproportionally long-limbed humanoid figure chasing them out of the property.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Notable Events</h3>
                <h4>The Golden Expedition</h4>
                <p>
                    No one in Grimsby ever lives to their fifties. This is because, at a certain age, they are taken on a compulsory expedition into the forest–a trip from which they never return.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    It is a quiet affair with no determinable date. Only the Provider, who presides over these expeditions, has any idea as to what happens during them.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Founders' Day</h4>
                <p>
                    Throughout history, some members of the Founding Families have experienced the same strange visions. These are believed to be the memories of one of Grimsby’s first Founders. Some of the notable visions are as follows: secret rooms that have never been seen before, or the woods back when the roots had not yet existed, or the unwelcoming faces of six strangers that to this day cannot be identified.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Some say that this is the Founder’s spirit attempting to communicate with them. But no one could piece together the clues; indeed, it seems the visions and what they stand for will forever remain a mystery, as the memories fade with each succeeding generation.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Regardless, a feast is still held yearly in the Founder’s honor, in an attempt to appease his seemingly restless spirit.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>The Red March</h4>
                <p>
                    This biannually held event features a procession that is open to all, regardless of age and occupation. A member of the Council will lead the group, following a prearranged trail, and participants are expected to follow in an orderly line with their bleeding hands joined together. There will be chanting and singing until the route culminates.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>The Scourging</h4>
                <p>
                    Once every few years, on an indeterminable date, the Scourging is held. This event serves as a grisly reminder of what would happen should someone dare to venture out into the Beyond. For this purpose, all residents of Grimsby are required to watch the proceedings.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Those who happen to be confined in the Tombs during this time are securely bound and brought to the edge of the woods, where they are made to wear iron casings around their feet and legs. Known as the Walking Boots, they force the wearer to advance in the general direction they were facing at the outset. This is a death sentence. With every step they take, they begin to rapidly decompose until–at a certain point far beyond the eyes could see–they are said to disintegrate into dust. Then, and only then, will the Walking Boots make their return.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Some of the Boots never make it back. This has given rise to a tale more horrifying than the reality of the Scourging itself: it is believed that some of the Scourged are somewhere out there in the beyond, unable to go any further for reasons out of their control but forced to keep trying anyway, rendering them in a permanent state of decomposition. Others believe they eventually return as animated skeletons, only to hide somewhere in the woods.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>The Trials</h4>
                <p>
                    The Trials, which take place once every twenty-five years, are considered to be the most important and highly anticipated event in Grimsby. All of Grimsby’s youth, who at the time of this event should be between thirteen to eighteen years of age, must undergo these tests. The results will determine their eventual role in society.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The first few levels are trivial, featuring nothing more than an exhibition of mundane skills and a written exam on the history, customs, and the slightly more difficult subject of manifestation magic. But once these levels are passed, the trials take a sinister turn, and each new test thrown their way will become progressively more difficult and dangerous than the last. They will be made to solve riddles that do not want to be solved, to contend with monsters both invincible and invisible, and to concentrate even in the most impossible situations. Only the most hardy, wilful, and resourceful individuals are able to withstand these tests. Others die or quit or simply fail in the process.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    What happens in each level differs with every trial held. Only the last level has remained the same through the years: the rite of passage.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The rite of passage requires all remaining contenders to venture out into the woods until they reach the end of their assigned path. They must use everything in their power to manifest curios that will aid them in their survival, despite not having any prior experience in manifestation magic up until this point. Many will fail before they even have a chance to try, for the illusions will quickly overwhelm them, if the creatures of the woods don’t get to them first.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The five that best impresses the Council will go on to become Heirs. Meanwhile, those who pass but are not among the top five may choose to become an apprentice Architect.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Notable Occupations</h3>
                <h4>Provider</h4>
                <p>
                    As the head of the Council and the most powerful person in all of Grimsby, the Provider should theoretically possess the most freedom out of them all. And yet, this could hardly be the case, for to become Provider is to be burdened with a piece of the forest’s soul. An uncommonly deep connection blossoms from this unity; with it, the Provider is able to communicate with the forest and determine its needs. In return, the Provider is endowed with an unnaturally long life, as well as powers only others could dream of.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    This is not common knowledge–not to the general public or even the Provider’s closest advisers. For the Provider is historically known to be a secretive and reclusive individual. Even the method by which a new Provider is chosen remains a mystery to most.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Council Members</h4>
                <p>
                    The Council consists of five members, each representing one of the Five Founding Families. If one of these members goes on to replace the previous generation’s Provider, the number of Council members drops down to four.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Their high position in society means that Council members are heavily advantaged and can get away with things most of the common folk cannot. They are also the few privy to Grimsby’s deep and darkest secrets. For this reason, the Council Members have their own tower to which only they have access–a place rumored to be bursting with books containing forbidden knowledge, not only of Grimsby but also of the outside world. </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Because there is much that the Council Members know that must be concealed from others, they speak to each other in a language only they can understand. This is a language they would have learned during their time as heirs.</p>
                <br />
                <h4>Heirs</h4>
                <p>
                    Heirs are chosen by means of a year-long trial, during which candidates must showcase their intelligence, resilience, and talents in manifestation magic. Only the best of the best will go on to become heirs, and will remain as such for a period of four years. During this time, they will be trained under the tutelage of the Provider so as to prepare them for when they become the next Council members.</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The Heirs have access to their own private tower separate from the Council, though it is much smaller and contains fewer books.
                </p>

                <h3>Inventory</h3>
                <h4>Bloodletter</h4>
                <p>
                    All architects, including heirs and council members, always have some kind of Bloodletter on their person. This item, which could take the form of something more covert than a mere blade, is what they use to draw blood during manifestation rituals.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Many inherit their bloodletters from their older relatives, though they can certainly choose to simply create their own.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <h4>Dress</h4>
                <p>
                    Fashion among the general populace is somewhat reminiscent of the early Regency Era, the time during which the town was founded. There may be notable differences–for instance, there seems to be an aversion to too-bright colors and a little less fascination for headwear–but the general silhouette remains the same: chemisettes, empire waistlines, and soft muslin dresses for women; muslin shirts, vests, tailcoats, and cravats for men.
                </p>

                    When on official business, the rulers, heirs, and architects of Grimsby don specially tailored cloaks of different colors depending on their station. This is to differentiate them from the general public. They are as follows:

                <h4>Scars</h4>
                <p>All practicing architects will, inevitably, develop scars as a consequence of the manifestation rites. These are marks of pride, as they signify the continuous sacrifices that they make in worship of the forest.</p>

                <h3>Cautionary Tales</h3>
                <h4>The Tale of the Talking Skull</h4>
                <p>
                    This is the story of Artorius Blackwood, who in his time was known for his unquenchable curiosity. It was Artorius who made the Council Tower what it is today. At least half of the books in the tower are his own. He was a fountain of knowledge, always experimenting with manifestation magic, pushing it to its limits and uncovering its grisly secrets. Unfortunately, this same curiosity is what led to his downfall.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    For Artorius Blackwood wanted to live forever. A lifetime of pursuing knowledge simply wasn’t enough for a man who wanted to know everything. And so, he set out to manifest an elixir that would grant him eternal life. He spent decades perfecting the concoction, testing it out on various animals and trying again when his experiments failed. Finally, one mouse showed promise. It had lived for a little over three years at this point, far past its original lifespan. Ecstatic, Artorius drank the elixir that he had used on the mouse, confident that his experiment had finally worked.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The next day, Artorius watched in horror as the mouse started to fall apart. It went through all the stages of decomposition, and yet it never died. Not really. Even as its tissues and cells broke down and its remains collapsed in on itself, the skull showed signs of life, squeaking impossibly, its incisors moving ever so imperceptibly. It was a glimpse into what would be Artorius’ eventual fate. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Because of his unusual circumstances, Artorius was spared from the Expedition. Instead, he was imprisoned in a tower, monitored by the Council who wanted to see what would happen to the man who had ingested a curio. Artorius sought to kill himself, but nothing would work. Even after all the mutilation he put himself through, his consciousness still remained intact. And so, as a last resort, he set himself on fire.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    At first, the pain was beyond anything he could have ever imagined… then it all faded away, and when he finally dared to look at himself he found that most of his physical form had crumbled into dust.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    All that remained were his skull and bones.
                </p>

                <h4>The Tale of the Roots</h4>
                <p>
                    In the depths of the forest lie the Roots–an entity so great, so formidable, that nothing could ever destroy it. Nobody knows what it is. Only one thing is for certain: it is a dangerous, unpredictable thing that must be avoided.

                <h3>The Grimoire</h3>
                <p>
                    The Grimoire is a slim leather-bound book where information on all known curios are painstakingly recorded. When opened, the tightly compressed sheets loosen up, revealing thousands upon thousands of crisp yellow pages that may seem limitless at a cursory glance. Despite its deceptively timeworn appearance, the Grimoire is nigh-indestructible. It is invulnerable to the usual hazards, whether it be fire, water, or the mere passage of time. Such sheer perfection in a curio could only be possible after many, many years of grueling work. Because it is so difficult to produce, there are only two Grimoire volumes, and they are greatly protected. What defenses the Grimoire has is not known, though there are many rumors and all of them equally horrifying.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    To find a particular entry in the Grimoire is a simple matter of opening the book and stating your request. If the information exists, the book will flick to the relevant page. Writing on the Grimoire, on the other hand, is a complicated and highly secret procedure. Only Council members are entrusted to do such a task.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    There are several stages that an Architect must undergo before their curio is added to the Grimoire:
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>The Proposition Stage</h4>
                <p>
                    Should an Architect desire to manifest a curio, they must first present themselves to the Council with a written proposal. If the proposal is deemed substantial enough, an interview will be scheduled for a later date. It is during this interview that the Council tests the Architect’s knowledge, skills, and state of mind with questions that can at times strike as invasive. The Architect must prove they are of sound mind and that they possess the necessary skills to undergo a manifestation ritual. They must also prove why the curio needs to exist in the first place. After all, it must possess something unique that other existing curios cannot already fulfill.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>The Approval Stage</h4>
                <p>
                    A proposal must be unanimously approved by the Council before it is presented to the Provider for final judgment. This stage in the process could take several weeks or months, depending on one’s social standing. Once the Provider sanctions the project, however, the Architect is free to proceed with the ritual whenever they wish.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>The Inspection Stage</h4>
                <p>
                    After the ritual, the Architect must report back to the Council with their results. Any discrepancies between the proposal and the manifested curio must be noted down. The curio will then spend at least a week in quarantine, locked in a tomb and guarded by one of Grimsby’s locals. If nothing strange or suspicious is observed during this time, the curio is returned to its owner.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>The Publishing Stage</h4>
                <p>
                    Finally, it is time for the entry to be added to the Grimoire. In the Council’s possession is the master volume, also known as the ‘true’ Grimoire. Unlike the inferior copy in the hands of the Founding Heirs, it can be written on. However, it takes a particular and very secret kind of ink to do so. Whenever a curio passes the inspection stage, the Council reconvenes and pools their blood together in an inkwell. This–the combined blood of Five Founding Families–is the substance used to write on the Grimoire. Whatever is written on the master volume will also appear in the copy. This is a near instantaneous process. However, the words may appear slightly faded as some of the blood would have been shared with the other book.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    And that is the entirety of this bureaucratic procedure. This is what one must undergo should they wish to follow all of Grimsby’s laws to the letter. But for those who are a little more impatient or have something to hide, there are other ways. For not all curios are recorded in the Grimoire. If one is careful enough, or resourceful enough, they could live out their entire lives without being punished for their crimes. Some keep their unregistered curios safely hidden away, a great power forever undisclosed. Some are a little more manipulative: participating in politics, bribing those notoriously corrupted Council members, faking the records. It all depends on one’s appetite for risk.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    However, if one is discovered, it could very well mean their death. Or worse.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Notable Curios</h3>
                <h4>Mist</h4>
                <p>
                    Grimsby’s ever-present mist is no work of nature; rather, it is manmade. It is believed to have been created by the first Founders as a way to conceal Grimsby from the rest of the world.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Portal Pairs</h4>
                <p>
                    As with all curios that break the laws of our natural world, portal pairs are extremely rare due to their complexity. These often take the form of ordinary items that may seem inconspicuous at first glance. A mirror portal, for example, would feel solid, sturdy–a tangible thing with no extraordinary purpose–until a bit of force is applied on its surface. The hard mass gives way to the pressure and becomes viscous and penetrable, thus revealing its true magical nature.

                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    All portals lead to the Labyrinth–a place that, according to the Council, appears situated in some other dimension. It is a strange place, a world of branching tunnels and dark chambers of a scale so large as to be unimaginable. Those who enter the Labyrinth are thus cautioned not to stray too far from their portals, lest they never find their way back. Yet, despite its size, distances in the real world are greatly reduced in the Labyrinth. This makes for a useful tool for traveling long distances. To illustrate, two portals located on either end of the castle would be in neighboring proximity in this dimension. However, this also has other uses: for instance, one could use the portals to hide dangerous or unregistered curios and hollows, or even for gatherings held in secret.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Noteworthy is the fact that portals in this dimension look exactly like their counterparts in the real world. The mirror would remain a mirror, reflecting its new surroundings. The tapestry would remain a tapestry, in all its elaborately woven glory. Traveling council members will also find themselves unchanged, even after what feels like ages of wandering. Time, after all, runs differently in this otherworldly place. One could spend hours here only to find that only a few minutes have gone by in their world of origin.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Any portal found in this dimension is traversable; one is not necessarily bound to the identical half of the portal they used to gain entry.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>Mirror Portal Pair</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Status: Unregistered</li>
                    <li>Classification: Curio</li>
                    <li>Creator: Unknown</li>
                    <li>Creation Date: Unknown</li>
                    <li>Fatal Flaw: Unknown</li>
                    <li>In possession of: Grimsworth</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The first portals to have ever been manifested are a set of ornate mirrors currently in Grimsworth’s possession. One is hidden somewhere in the castle, its precise location unknown even to the Founding Families. The castle refuses to take them there even when implored, perhaps because Grimsworth has willed it so. The other mirror-portal is somewhere in the outside world, passed from one house to another as it transports more and more outsiders to Grimsby.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Both mirrors measure up to about two feet in width and length–a size large enough to crawl through, though not so large as to be hopelessly unwieldy. The frame is a pure silver upon which a twisting pattern of leaves are meticulously embossed.

                <h4>TAPESTRY PORTAL PAIR</h4>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Status: Unregistered</li>
                        <li>Classification: Curio</li>
                        <li>Creator: TBA</li>
                        <li>Creation Date: 19th Century</li>
                        <li>Fatal Flaw: Unknown</li>
                        <li>In possession of: The Hollows (Current), The Council (Former)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    Ever since the early 19th century when it was first created, the tapestry had been a centerpiece in the Council Tower, used primarily by members as a secret alternative route to the woods. There, it was cleverly concealed. One of the tombs had been repurposed and locked from the inside so as to keep the tapestry safe. This way, no wandering architect would stumble upon it, and even if one were aware of its general location, the tombs are nigh-indistinguishable from each other that it would be difficult–if not impossible–to find it.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It was not until the arrival of the outsiders that both tapestries mysteriously disappeared, leading the Council to believe that these incidents are somehow correlated. In truth, one of the tapestries is now in the hands of the Hollows, whereas its pair is somewhere else in the woods, bound to the earth in that dark place sullied by death. The malevolent Roots keep it in place, its long twisting fingers penetrating the fibrous surface.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The tapestries are about five feet in both width and length and feature an ever-shifting pattern of interwoven worlds. They move ever so imperceptibly, the depictions ranging from a series of inconspicuous landscapes to rivers flowing with blood, trees made entirely from bones, or even mountains dotted with the silhouettes of large, mythical beings.

                    <li>The Heirs have varying levels of proficiency in their language and as such, may not always use this to communicate.</li>
                    <li>Because of their continued isolation since the 19th century, they are unfamiliar with pop culture, current events, and do not have access to modern technology. Their way of life is very much dated.</li>
                    <li>The Founding Families know that they can communicate with the castle should they wish to quickly travel from one room or hall to another.</li>
