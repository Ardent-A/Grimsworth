                    Tucked away in a hidden valley, shrouded in ever-present mist, lies the sleepy village of Grimsby. It would seem painfully ordinary–this collection of farmlands and shabby wooden houses–were it not for the gothic castle that looms in the west. An impossible fortress entrenched on a mountain, it is the home of the Five Founding Families, rulers of Grimsby and keepers of its many secrets. For hundreds of years, they had kept the village and its fantastical nature concealed from the rest of the world. Until one day, the outsiders arrived at their gates.

                    They all tell the same story: an experience of loss, a mysterious individual at the doorstep, an invitation to an exclusive university for magic learning. These were all the necessary ingredients to lure them away from their ordinary lives and into this unpredictable place. But with every day spent at the castle, it becomes apparent that this is no place of enchantment, nor of innocent wonder or wise all-knowing mentors. Instead, the rules are obscure, the lessons peculiar and at times even distressing, and the people who live here want them all dead.

                    Worse still, magic is more sinister than they had imagined. It originates from the forest, that encroaching ocean of darkness that maroons the village from the outside world. It has birthed a relentless evil that manifests in the rotten husks of the dead trees, the withered grass, the wild roots that crawl endlessly along the ground like a parasite. The woods are choked with monsters, and they are thirsty for blood.

                    Everything about this place is telling the outsiders to run, run and never look back. There’s only one problem:
