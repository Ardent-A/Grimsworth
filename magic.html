                <h3></h3>
                <p>
                    The forest is a reflection of one’s mind. Here, all conscious and subconscious fears and desires come to life in the form of illusions. Subconscious thoughts manifest themselves as mere shadows, voices, or suggestions of a presence–a glimpse of a running child seen from the corner of one’s eye, a whispering voice in the dark, a nagging feeling of being watched–whereas conscious thoughts are more readily discerned; the stronger they are the more true to life they seem.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    This is a self-perpetuating cycle. Every subconscious thought that comes alive in the forest will inevitably become conscious, thereby worsening the illusions. However, illusions cannot affect the physical world around them, nor can they directly cause an individual harm. Further, they cannot materialize outside the boundaries of the forest.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Although navigating the woods can be tricky, it is not such a hopeless task. As a general rule, practicing mindfulness and meditation should enable an individual to catch a fleeting thought and recognize it for what it is, lending them the ability to distinguish what is real and what is imagined. It is also possible to consciously transform illusions or will them away on command, though this ability is rare even among the most proficient of architects. After all, there is only one prerequisite to learning manifestation magic: the ability to venture into the woods undeterred despite all its lurking horrors.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    <b>Manifestation</b>
                    <br />
			        n.
                    <br />
			        A form in which an idea is revealed
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    To manifest an illusion is to give it corporeal form, to allow it to affect the world around them and exist beyond the boundaries of the woods. This entails a long and arduous ritual that could span several weeks, months, or even years depending on the complexity of the item or creature being conjured. And yet the ritual can seem deceptively straightforward at first. It takes inspiration from basic horticulture: the act of planting a seed in the forest and nurturing it, until such a time that it is ready for harvest. But where it deviates from conventional horticulture is in the details. Anything could act as a seed–a necklace, an old ragdoll, even another manifestation. But it also needs something more potent than water to survive: the maker’s blood. Blood is the conduit–it is that which forms a momentary connection between an architect’s consciousness and the forest. With the combined power of an architect’s imagination and the forest’s magic, one can will almost anything into existence.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Yet even with all this, a successful ritual is not guaranteed. It is notoriously rare for a manifested artifact–also known as a curio–to turn out exactly as one imagines it, for rituals not only require creativity but also demand an unwavering focus and a keen eye for detail. To let one’s thoughts wander is to contaminate the curio with unrelated ideas. To leave one thing ambiguous is to allow the forest to take creative liberties. Indeed, no amount of specificity is too excessive. Architects typically spend months on end researching and preparing blueprints until every minute detail is studied and committed to memory. Every attribute, from an object’s shape and texture down to the way it shifts colors under certain lighting, must be carefully envisaged. This makes otherworldly concepts difficult to manifest accurately, for they are far more challenging to imagine.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    There will always be some kind of discrepancy between the concept and the final result. To close this discrepancy as much as humanly possible is a commendable display of effort. Unfortunately, the fallible nature of the human mind is such that even the most competent of architects are bound to make mistakes. In the worst cases, these mistakes could be deadly. It is paramount, therefore, that an architect visualizes failsafes into their curios in the event they must be immediately and irrevocably destroyed. A failsafe could be an uttered word, an Achilles’ heel, or a vulnerability to certain elements, but it is standard practice to apply multiple different mechanisms in case one proves ineffective.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    With time and practice, an architect will develop an intuition for the art–a sixth sense, if you will. They will be able to feel the subtle changes in their curio as if it were a part of them. This is a great advantage, as otherwise there is no way of knowing how a manifestation ritual has progressed; the seed shifts and grows deep in the earth, remaining unseen until the ritual ends and the curio is unearthed. At this point, it is in its final form and can no longer be altered, short of using it as a seed in a new ritual.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>CLASSIFICATIONS</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    As per the instruction of the Council of Architects, manifested artifacts are classified as follows: 
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    <b>Curios</b> - Typically inanimate, does not simulate intelligence. But it can also be used as a shorthand to refer to all manifested artifacts.
                    <br />
                    <b>Hollow Ones (abbr. Hollows)</b> - Typically animate and may share resemblance to living creatures like animals or human beings, but are said not to have a soul. Hollows cannot bleed true blood. When they do “bleed”, which happens sometimes, the substance is merely an inferior imitation rather than the real thing. It cannot be used as a blood sacrifice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to these classifications, an animate pen that can speak and simulate emotions would classify as a Hollow rather than a Curio. An inanimate artifact that has the appearance of a human, down to the pores of its skin and the working organs in its body is considered a Curio, for as long as it does not exhibit any sign of emotion or intelligence; indeed, such an artifact would merely be the equivalent of a doll. However, in such a case where an object exhibits one quality from each classification, intelligence (or the lack thereof) takes precedence. For example, a coin that has the ability to move without an external force but does not exhibit intelligence will be considered a Curio.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>STRATEGIES</h3>
                <br />
                <h4>TRICKLE</h4>
                <p>
                    There is no measurable rate at which blood must flow from the architect to the seed, but it is a widely held belief that a slow trickle of blood is optimal. Light bleeding is easily stanched should the need arise, such as when an architect suddenly finds themselves distracted by extraneous stimuli. This way, curios are less likely to get contaminated, even if it may take longer for them to reach the desired final form.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    On the other hand, a heavy outpouring of blood can instantaneously transform a seed into a curio, but this has multiple drawbacks. One big disadvantage is that it will be heavily influenced by the forest’s will, and may even turn out to be completely different from the architect’s original vision. An architect can also unknowingly lose a dangerous amount of blood, thereby risking their life in the process.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>INTERMINGLE</h4>
                <p>
                    It is possible for two or more architects to work on the same ritual. This is called blood intermingling, which–depending on the amount of participants–can cut manifestation time by at least half, allowing the rapid production of all sorts of complex curios. On paper, this sounds like an attractive concept, if only it wasn’t so difficult to properly execute. The more participants there are, the higher the likelihood that ideas will conflict; as the adage goes, too many cooks spoil the broth.

                    Intermingling with animal blood, on the other hand, is a controversial subject. Curios borne out of animal blood are said to be unpredictable, but it is hard to say whether this is due to the animal’s lower cognitive potential or the forest’s own intervention. Either way, there is little information on this subject.  The last time this was attempted, more than half of Grimsby’s livestock was wiped out, subjecting the village to near-famine. It has been outlawed since.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>LIMITATIONS</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    It is certainly possible for a curio to stimulate evolution and aging for as long as an architect has visualized them to possess this ability. But it is only that: a mimicry. It requires the utmost precision–a matter of visualizing the incremental changes a curio will undergo for every moment that it exists–and will likely take a lot of blood, focus, and many years to complete. Most architects do not find this to be worth the effort, and as a result, curios in Grimsby are typically unchanging–or as in the case of Hollows, never-aging.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Naturally developed sentience among Hollows is also said to be impossible. As far as the Council is aware, Hollows can only ever mimic intelligence if the architect has intended for them to do so. No matter how convincing such intelligence may seem, it is only ever artificial, as Hollows do not have a soul.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Curios in general also do not have the capability to physically generate matter out of thin air. This is known as self-duplication. A curio will only ever be as finite as the amount of blood that was sacrificed to create it. For a curio to be infinite necessitates an equally infinite amount of blood sacrificed, which is unheard of. According to this limitation, such things as a book with infinite pages or an endless pool of water cannot be manifested.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>THE ARCANE THEORIES</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The intricacies of Manifestation magic are not well understood, for there is only so much that can be rationalized about an otherworldly force that defies the laws of nature. What modicum of understanding the Council has gathered over hundreds of years is all thanks to those who have risked their lives in pursuit of answers, but even then, they are nowhere near conclusive. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>THE FOREST IS SENTIENT</h4>
                <p>
                    A curio is said to be a collaborative work between the architect and the forest. The forest can influence how curios ultimately materialize, lending a helping hand–even if undesired–when one fails to visualize enough detail into their work.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    But even the most meticulous architect will encounter problems if the forest believes their curio to be a threat to itself. Up to a certain extent, it has the power to veto an architect’s decisions. It does not have the ability to destroy a curio or prevent its conjuring, but the forest will change it in subtle ways in the name of self-preservation.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>THE FOREST NEEDS BLOOD TO SURVIVE</h4>
                <p>
                    The relationship between the architects and the forest is a mutually beneficial one. The architects provide the forest with their blood, and in return, they gain the momentary ability to imagine almost anything into existence.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    It is unknown where the blood actually goes after it has been sacrificed. Some say it’s absorbed by the forest itself. Others say it’s absorbed by the curio. Whatever the case, manifestations are brought out of the ground covered in blood, like a newborn child when it emerges from the womb.
                </p>
		<br />
		<h3>THE FORBIDDEN RITE</h3>
		<p>
		    The Forbidden Rite is so dark, so unspeakable, that for centuries only the Provider has had any knowledge of its existence and how it can be successfully performed. It works much in the same way an ordinary manifestation ritual does, with one exception: the seed must be a living human being, alive when buried and alive when the transmutation begins. This is a ritual that not only sacrifices blood, but also sacrifices a soul.
	    	</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		    This is the only way to manifest a curio that bleeds true blood and possesses a soul of its own–otherwise referred to as ‘true sentience’ by the Council. The caveat is that these characteristics are not manifested by default. An architect must evoke them the same way other characteristics are. It is possible for a human seed to bear a curio with neither true sentience nor true blood if an architect has never specifically declared them. 
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		    However, there is something that architects have no control over, and it is the simple fact that Hollows created through the Forbidden Rite possess the ability to evolve beyond the creator’s original vision. This typically manifests as subtle physical changes, but it is also possible for such Hollows to develop a sentience of their own and acquire the ability to bleed true blood.
